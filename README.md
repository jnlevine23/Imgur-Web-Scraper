# Imgur-Web-Scraper
A Basic Imgur Scraping Script. The user can specify their search criteria in the command line and the program will search Imgur for that particular phrase. The program then displays the top images based on relevance in new browser tabs. Maximum five images will be opened unless a search returns less than five results.
